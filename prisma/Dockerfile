	# â†‘ This inverted grep match is because using Docker's 'cache' mount type
	# causes Docker to place the pnpm content-addressable store on a different virtual drive,
	# which prohibits pnpm from symlinking its content to its virtual store (in node_modules/.pnpm),
	# and that causes pnpm to fall back on copying the files. And that's fine,
	# except pnpm emits a lot of warnings doing that, so here we filter out those warnings.
